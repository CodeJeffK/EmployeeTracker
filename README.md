## Description
This is the 12th challenge for the UW Coding bootcamp. For this challenge, we had to create a command-line application using 
NodeJS that is capable of viewing and interacting with information in the SQL database. This application uses the ``Inquirer`` package for prompting the user 
as well as ``Console.table`` to print mySQL to the console.
